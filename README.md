# DSA with C++

This repository contains my solutions, notes, and practice problems as I learn **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **C++**. It is intended to document my learning progress, reinforce concepts through hands-on coding, and serve as a personal reference for revision.

## 📚 About

The goal of this repository is to build a solid understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithms, including but not limited to:

- Arrays and Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees and Graphs
- Recursion and Backtracking
- Sorting and Searching Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Hashing
- Bit Manipulation

Each topic includes a set of C++ practice problems, often inspired by common interview questions and competitive programming challenges.

## 💡 Why C++?

C++ provides fine-grained control over memory, performance, and data structures — making it an excellent language for learning DSA. Many competitive programming platforms and technical interviews also use C++ due to its speed and STL (Standard Template Library) support.

## 🛠️ Structure

The repository is organized by topic, and each folder contains relevant C++ source files and problem explanations wherever necessary.

Example structure:

```
dsa-cpp/
├── arrays/
├── linked_lists/
├── stacks_queues/
├── trees/
├── graphs/
├── dp/
├── sorting/
└── misc/
```

## 🚀 Learning Objectives

- Develop a deep understanding of core data structures and algorithms.
- Improve problem-solving and coding efficiency.
- Prepare for coding interviews and competitive programming contests.
- Build strong foundations for systems programming and software development.
